TODO
* the optimization should allow for configuration and not follow the global method
* The resize functions (constraint methods) should be moved to an extensibleÂ and customizable system.
* resize animated images
* gifsicle - check output of interlace and non-interlace options
* testing instructions
* dealing with files/filelike objects was an "elegant hack" under python2. with python3 support it is messy and might not have the expected results.

* tests:
* ensure we have resized image sizes, and not 0
