------------------
- not backwards compatible. sorry.

# Tracking the "archive" image was changed.

1. photo_sizes now reserve an initial @ character for internal usage
2. archived fullsize images are now tracked as:

	dict[bucket_name]['@archive'][filename]

before there was a dual-use dict, that was just hard to manage

	dict[public_bucket_name][size][filename]
	dict[archive_bucket_name][filename]

this created issues where you couldn't save the archived image to the same s3 bucket.  now you can.

# added s3_generate_filenames

this call just generates the filenames that would be saved to s3.  
this is necessary for deletion or external auditing of your uploads

# added s3_delete

you can now delete s3 files

# this still doesn't have proper tests

check the demo.py
